# Composer module

The Composer module consists of:
* the [composer](../src/composer) Python module for authoring compositions,
* the [pycompose](../src/pycompose) and [pydeploy](../src/pydeploy) commands for
  managing compositions from the command line.

The documentation for the Composer package is organized as follows:
- [COMPOSITIONS.md](COMPOSITIONS.md) gives a brief introduction to compositions.
- [COMBINATORS.md](COMBINATORS.md) explains the composition constructs.
- [COMMANDS.md](COMMANDS.md) describes the `pycompose` and `pydeploy` commands.
